# 🧠 Machine Learning — Projects & Tasks

This folder collects my hands-on work in **machine learning** and **deep learning**:
- end-to-end projects (PyTorch) in the **Projects** section
- focused experiments covering main concepts of AI and exercises in the **Tasks** section

> Tools: Python|NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, PyTorch, XGBoost|, Weights & Biases (W&B), Jupyter notebooks

## 🚀 What’s inside

- **Projects:**
  - **Landslide-Prediction-UNet-R2UNet** — Semantic segmentation of landslide-prone areas from multi-channel geospatial raster data (Papua New Guinea). Compared U-Net and R2U-Net architectures with Weights & Biases experiment tracking and end-to-end data preprocessing in PyTorch.
- **Tasks:**
  - **MLP-Zero-Init-Symmetry** — Demonstrates the symmetry problem in a 2-layer neural network with zero-initialized weights and biases, showing that identical gradients prevent learning (XOR task).
  - **XOR-Linear-vs-2LayerNN** — Built a linear baseline that fails on XOR and a two-layer ReLU network that learns it perfectly; demonstrates why nonlinear capacity matters in practice.
  - **Optimizer-Comparison-Rosenbrock-Booth** — Adam / SGD / RMSProp / Adagrad convergence.
  - **Facies-Classification-Well-Logs** — DTS regression + facies classification (XGBoost + DNN) with EDA and confusion matrices.
  - **Sobel-Edges-PyTorch-vs-skimage** — custom conv2d filters vs `skimage` Sobel.
